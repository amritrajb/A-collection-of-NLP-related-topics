# A collection of NLP related topics


Think of the last time you used a voice-assistant. Maybe Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, or maybe Google Assistant. Well, voice-assistants are just one of the many applications of Natural Language Processing, the focus of this presentation. NLP is something used in various day-to-day technologies, so this presentation should shed some light on the mechanics of those technologies.
I’m a data science student at Purdue, so Natural Language Processing is something very closely related to my field that I explore and apply and also something that I am quite interested in.
To understand the basics of Natural Language Processing, we will first look at defining what it is, then we will explore its applications, and finally take a look at its future. //

The slides also have an annotated bibliography with various references linked at the end.
